===============================================================================

- Fixed : Some potential crashes related to incorrect string handling.
- Fixed : There were reports of the motion sensor remaining red after players

          Tracker 2.0 if they already owned Trace Tracker 1.0

          handled less often corrupted without warning.
- Fixed : Some possible problems with refreshing the graphics after another
          window has been displayed over Uplink. This will need further testing
          on different machines, since problems are heavily dependant upon
          system hardware and driver configuration.
- Fixed : Graphical glitch where a security bypass would remain visible even
          when the connection analyser is closed.
- Fixed : A number of actual and potential memory leaks.

- Changed : A plot error will no longer crash Uplink, but will send an email to
            the player. This is generally a problem of using old, incompatible
            agent files.

- Support : In the event of a crash, the currently loaded agent file will be
            sent to Introversion for debugging purposes, with the user's

- Fixed : Crash when negotiating for a mission in 1.31b
- Fixed : Processor upgrades should not cause crashes

          taking to identify possible causes of problems.
- Fixed : It is no longer possible to add or remove links from the map whilst
          the large map is showing. This would cause the map locations to jump
          around erraticly.
- Fixed : Map locations should now have a very low probability of overlapping
          thanks to code from François Gagné.
- Fixed : It is now possible to remove nodes from a connection chain by
          clicking on them when they are already in the chain, thanks to code
          from François Gagné.

- Added : A screenshot can be saved by pressing the backtick (`) button, which
          is found left of "1" on most PC keyboards. At the moment, only one
          screenshot can be saved at a time and it is overwritten whenever a
          new one is taken. It is saved as the "users/screenshot.bmp"

- Changed : Should no longer hog the CPU, as requested by some users. If this
            causes jerkiness for testers then it will be removed or made
            optional.

         bought the game.

- Note : The game will crash if you load old (pre-1.31) saved games due to new

          a mouseover of some items.
- Fixed : A number of minor memory leaks.

          longer causes the locations to jump around forever. The locations are
          added back into the map correctly.

- Support : Added the facility to send user information so that we can contact
            you should you encounter a fatal error. Please edit the file called
            "userinfo.txt" in the Uplink directory with contact details if you
            are happy to be contacted. They will not be used for any other
            purpose.

                event of a crash (at user discretion). Please make use of this
                functionality to help us improve the game

                               VERSION 1.31
===============================================================================

            start a new game OR load a game.  Newly found LANs will be added
            to your existing game - there is no longer any need to start a new
            user to load new LAN files.
- Changed : Map scrolling speed now resolution independent.

          text of a news article
- Fixed : The default IRC channel was set to #uplink-test instead of #uplink

          userfile to become unloadable if you bounced a connection through
          multiple computers with the same name - eg "Arc Access Terminal"

- Linux : * Fixed theming
          * DOS text files are now read in properly (this affected
            custom LANs and gateways)
	      * Save games are now stored in ~/.uplink
	      * Graphics backend is now OpenGL/SDL (previously used glut)

                    gateways can be added.
                    See mods.txt for more information.
                    
- New Mod stuff :   Uplink now supports Skins.  New skins can be added by 
                    creating a new folder containing a text file titled

                    used.  The theme.txt file can include colour information 
                    as well.  Themes can be selected from a menu in the 
                    options screen.                    
                    See mods.txt for more information.

- Changed : You now have to click twice to abandon a mission.

- Fixed : Uplink would lock up sometimes on a certain date, every time. 
          Caused sometimes when ALL agents were dead or in jail. 
          Often occured after the "Mole" secret mission.
- Fixed : chris@introversion.co.uk was getting overloaded with bug reports
- Fixed : world.dat is not closed properly at one point
- Fixed : It was possible to delete Internic from the links screen - 
          effectively ending the game for the player
- Fixed : Your score goes very high if you have hacked banks due to the money.
          The maximum score available for money is now 100,000 points, 
          available if you have 10 Million credits or more.

- Fixed : Spelling mistakes : dissavow, veryify, analysys
- Fixed : Uplink would crash upon launch if its install directory was longer 
          than 64 characters long.  Where the hell did I learn to code.
- Fixed : On the console, if you typed 'cd blablabla' it would crash, 
          so long as the directory name had more than 8 characters in it.
- Fixed : Sometimes a "ghost" email icon would be left on the screen, 
          which would crash the game when clicked on.  
          The same occured (less frequently) for "ghost" missions.
- Fixed : Crashes would often occur if all computers were disabled - for 
          example during an outbreak of Revelation.
- Fixed : Crashes often occured when replying to a Steal-All-Files mission.
- Fixed : Crash bug that would occur when changing a log type to 
          TransferTO or TransferFROM
- Fixed : Destroy-All-Files mission would sometimes target an empty system.
- Fixed : Uplink Corporation will now stop you from buying Modems if your
          Gateway bandwidth would make the purchase pointless.  eg buying a 
          5gq/s modem for a gateway with a bandwidth of 2gq/s.

- Fixed : Uplink sometimes refuses to load a save game file, 
          and simply crashes during the attempt.  Caused by incorrectly 
          saved log file data after using a V4 log deleter.  
          Often occurs after gateway upgrade.  
          Regular Forum members will know this bug as "The Log Deleter V4 bug".

- Fixed : If you delete a file whilst copying it, Uplink crashes.
- Fixed : If you run two file deleters on the same file, Uplink crashes.
- Fixed : Minor problem with the "Mole" special mission <snip - spoilers>
- Fixed : Problems sometimes caused by modifying your own criminal record
